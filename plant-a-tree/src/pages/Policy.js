      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: 1st October 2019</p>
      <p>
        We at TreeCo are committed to treating the personal information of our
        customers with care and respect. <br />
        This Privacy Statement relates to TreeCo and its nurseries, which are
        owned and operated by local TreeCo Members. This Privacy Statement
        explains how TreeCo collects, stores, uses and discloses personal
        information about its customers. All our stores strive to take a
        consistent approach to privacy practice but may occasionally handle
        personal information differently. Our stores will tell you before
        collecting, using or disclosing personal information in ways not covered
        by this statement. As you’ll see below, we ensure that our practices
        comply with the Privacy Act 1993 but we strive to do better than that,
        and meet industry best practice.
      </p>

      <h3>TreeCo is Data Warranted</h3>
      <p>
        TreeCo NZ was one of the first retail organisations in New Zealand to be
        awarded Data Warranty Register (DWR) Certification. The DWR was
        developed and issued by the NZ Marketing Association and provides
        consumers with confidence that organisations such as TreeCo NZ, will
        treat personal information with care and respect, in accordance with the
        law, and industry best practice (which often exceeds legal
        requirements).
      </p>

      <h3>Information we collect from you</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the personal information we collect about you is provided to us
        directly during your interactions with us at our stores or on our
        website, www.mitre10.co.nz, including when you become a member of our
        Plant-A-Tree site. We always take care to ensure that we only collect
        personal information needed to provide our services and help run our
        business. The types of personal information we may collect include:
        Contact information, including your name, address, telephone number and
        email address; Account (and payment) information; and Purchase
        information, such as specific products purchased, dates of purchase and
        any returns.
      </p>
      <h3>How we keep your personal information secure</h3>
      <p>
        The personal information we collect about you is held by TreeCo and by
        our trusted data storage providers. Our stores may also retain some
        personal information securely onsite. We take all reasonable steps to
        ensure that the personal information we hold is protected against loss,
        unauthorised use, access or disclosure and any other misuse. We apply
        careful administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are
        appropriate for the sort of information we collect, to ensure that your
        information is safe and secure at all times. We retain your personal
        information only for as long as we need it and we destroy the
        information we no longer need in a secure manner.
      </p>

      <h3>Your right to request a copy of your personal information</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request a copy of any personal information TreeCo
        holds about you. The types of information we may hold about you are
        listed above. Please note that you can only request personal information
        about yourself, unless you have the consent of another person to request
        information on their behalf. You can request a copy of your personal
        information by emailing us at privacy@treeco.co.nz or writing to us at

      </p>

      <h3>Any further questions or complaints</h3>
      <p>
        Where we have refused a request for access to, or correction of,
        personal information or where you have any other concerns about the way
        we have handled your personal information, you have the right to make a
        complaint. In the first instance, please let us know about your concerns
        by contacting our national Privacy Officer using the contact details set
        out above. We’ll do everything we can to put the matter right, but if we
        can’t resolve your complaint for you, then you have the right to make a
        complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner by: • completing an
        online complaint form at www.privacy.org.nz; or • writing to the Office
        of the Privacy Commissioner, PO Box 10-094, The Terrace, Wellington
        6143.
      </p>

      <h3>Updates to our Privacy Statement</h3>
      <p>
        From time to time we may update this Privacy Statement, to reflect
        changes to our business, products or services or changes to the Privacy
        Act. We’ll update the Privacy Statement on our website, but may not
        otherwise notify our customers of a change, so please make sure you
        review it periodically to ensure you’re up to date with our privacy
        practices.

      <h1>Return Policy</h1>
      <p>This is Policy Page.</p>
      <h3>Delivery and Returns</h3>
      <p>
        Here at TreeCo we offer a quick, safe and affordable set of options for
        delivering your online purchase to you. Plus if you’re not satisfied
        with your purchase, simply read the No Hassle Returns information below
        to find out how to return it to us.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>Timeframes</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to deliver your order within 5 to 10 working days to most areas.
        Delivery to rural addresses and the lower South Island may take up to 14
        days. On the rare occasion that there’s a delay or stock issue we’ll let
        you know right away.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>Delivery destinations</h3>
      <p>
        Our Home Delivery option is available within New Zealand and to physical
        addresses only. Our couriers cannot deliver to PO Box addresses as we
        require a signature on delivery. This helps us to ensure your product
        arrives safely. Requests for a special order or online quotes will be
        responded to within 1 to 2 working days and we will let you know then
        the likely timeframe for supply and delivery.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>No Hassle Returns</h3>
      <p>
        We are happy to exchange or refund any unopened and unused,
        non-customised items returned to us in their original condition and
        packaging, including all accessories and the invoice or delivery docket,
        within 28 days. Customised products, which include products cut,
        made-to-measure, special order or mixed to specific requirements, cannot
        be refunded or exchanged. Clearance items or products purchased during
        Clearance events in our stores, cannot be returned or exchanged. We will
        refund to your original payment method where possible or, if you prefer,
        we can issue you a TreeCo gift card for the sum equal to the cost of the
        product excluding handling and any delivery or returns costs.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>Faulty Goods</h3>
      <p>
        If a problem occurs with a product purchased from TreeCo, bring it back
        to us with your proof of purchase. We will either repair, replace or
        provide you with a refund, as set out in the Consumer Guarantees Act.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Cancelling Your Order</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish to cancel your order you will need to contact the TreeCo
        store that is processing your order. Please check the order confirmation
        email sent to you after submitting your order for detail of which TreeCo
        store is processing your order. We cannot guarantee that it will be
        possible to cancel your order as it may have already been processed. If
        we are able to cancel your order prior to dispatch, any charge to your
        credit or debit card will be refunded. Our No Hassle Returns policy will
        apply in this instance.{" "}
