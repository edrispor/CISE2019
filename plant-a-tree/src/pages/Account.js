          This is Account Page.I want my app to stand out among others by having
          cool features For example, in order to help clients select a tree, I
          want them to be able to see what it would look like planted at their
          own house. Even more, what it would look like now, in 1 year, in 2
          years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. So, I want them to be able to take
          a photo of the place at their house they want the tree and then drag a
          photo of the tree into their garden and change the age (height and
          width) of the tree
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
